# 🌍 Countries' Flags and Happiness: Exploring the Connection Between National Symbols and Well-being  

> Sabancı University **DSA210** Introduction to Data Science Course Spring 2024-2025 Term Project.
> Combining data science with social sciences to uncover insights hidden in national symbols.  



## Introduction  

This project explores whether national flags — through their colors, symbols, and patterns — may reflect deeper elements of a country, such as its **happiness, economy, and social support**.  

As someone interested in **social sciences and cultural studies**, I have always been fascinated by how symbols represent societies. Flags are important national symbols, but do they tell us something meaningful about a country's well-being? Through this project, I aim to investigate the **relationship between flag designs and real-world indicators like happiness scores and GDP**.

## Motivation  

National flags are more than just beautiful pieces of cloth — they represent a country's identity, history, culture, and beliefs. As a person who has always been curious about **how culture connects to society's well-being**, I wanted to adress this topic from a **data science perspective**.  

Some questions I am curious to explore:  
- Are countries with **blue flags** happier on average?  
- Do **religious symbols** in flags reflect differences in GDP or happiness?  
- Are there visible patterns in flag designs based on **geographic regions or economic status**?  

Although there are studies about the cultural and political meaning of flags, **there is little to no data-driven research**into how flag aspects link to social variables such as happiness. That makes this a **creative and original** project combining data science with social science.

## Data Sources  

1. **World Flags Dataset**  
   - **Source**: [Kaggle - World Flags](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edoardoba/world-flags)  
   - **Description**: Contains features of flags from 193 countries, including:  
     - Colors (red, blue, green, etc.)  
     - Symbols (religious symbols, crosses, etc.)  
     - Geographic information (landmass, zone)  
     - Population, language, religion  

2. **World Happiness Report 2019**  
   - **Source**: [Kaggle - World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness)  
   - **Description**: Contains happiness scores and detailed well-being indicators for 156 countries, such as:  
     - Happiness score  
     - GDP per capita  
     - Social support  
     - Healthy life expectancy  
     - Freedom to make life choices  
     - Generosity  
     - Perceptions of corruption

## Data Merging Plan  

- Since the two datasets have different country lists (193 vs. 156), I will focus on **the common countries that appear in both datasets**.  
-Since the country names do not match exactly between datasets (e.g., 'UK' vs. 'United Kingdom'), I plan to handle this issue using manual mapping and fuzzy matching techniques to ensure proper alignment for analysis.

Steps:  
1. **Standardize country names** to match them correctly.  
2. **Merge the datasets** on country names.  
3. Handle missing data if necessary.

## Data Analysis  

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**  
- Clean and organize both datasets for analysis.  
- **Standardize country names** to ensure they match across both datasets.  
- **Select relevant features** from each dataset (flag features, happiness score, GDP, etc.).  
- **Handle missing values** appropriately (imputation or removal if necessary).  
- **Merge datasets** on country names to create a combined dataset for analysis.  

---

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Analyze **distribution of flag features** (colors, symbols, patterns).  
- **Visualize happiness scores and GDP** across different flag features.  
- Explore how flag elements (e.g., color, religious symbols) vary across **continents, regions, and income levels**.  
- Identify **initial patterns** or interesting relations between flag designs and happiness or economic indicators.  

---

### 3. **Correlation Analysis**  
- Examine **relationships** between flag features and happiness-related indicators.  
- Investigate if **specific flag colors or symbols** are associated with **higher happiness scores or GDP**.  
- Check if there are **correlations between geographic variables (landmass, zone)** and happiness.  

---

### 4. **Visualization**  
- Create **visualizations** to represent trends and correlations in the data.  
- Use **bar charts, histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, scatter plots** to explore relationships.  
- Examples of visualizations will include:  
  - **Average happiness score by flag color (e.g., blue vs. non-blue flags)**.  
  - **GDP distribution for countries with and without religious symbols in flags**.  
  - **Heatmaps showing correlation between flag complexity (number of colors, symbols) and happiness or GDP**.

## Possible Challenges  

| Challenge                                  | Solution                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Country name mismatches**                 | Manual adjustments and fuzzy matching if needed.              |
| **Missing data in happiness scores**       | Imputation (filling gaps) or excluding some countries.         |
| **Encoding flag features for analysis**    | Using binary or one-hot encoding for categorical flag data.   |
| **Finding meaningful correlations**        | Focus on both data-driven results and social science context. |

## Future Work  

- Add more datasets (e.g., Democracy Index, Human Development Index) to deepen the analysis.  
- Include historical flag data to analyze changes over time.  
- Explore **interactive data visualizations** (e.g., Plotly, Dash) to present findings dynamically.  
- Apply advanced **machine learning models** to predict social indicators from flag designs.
