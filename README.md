# 🌍 Countries' Flags and Happiness: Exploring the Connection Between National Symbols and Well-being  

## Introduction  

This project explores whether national flags — through their colors, symbols, and patterns — can reflect deeper aspects of a country, such as its **happiness, economy, and social support**.  

As someone interested in **social sciences and cultural studies**, I have always been fascinated by how symbols represent societies. Flags are powerful national emblems, but do they tell us something meaningful about a country's well-being? Through this project, I aim to investigate the **relationship between flag designs and real-world indicators like happiness scores and GDP**.

## Motivation  

National flags are more than just colorful pieces of cloth — they are symbols of a country's identity, history, culture, and beliefs. As a person who has always been curious about **how culture connects to society's well-being**, I wanted to approach this question from a **data science perspective**.  

Some questions I am curious to explore:  
- Are countries with **blue flags** happier on average?  
- Do **religious symbols** in flags reflect differences in GDP or happiness?  
- Are there visible patterns in flag designs based on **geographic regions or economic status**?  

Although there are studies about the cultural and political meaning of flags, **there is little to no data-driven research** exploring how flag elements relate to social indicators like happiness. That makes this a **creative and original** project combining data science with social science.

## Data Sources  

1. **World Flags Dataset**  
   - **Source**: [Kaggle - World Flags](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edoardoba/world-flags)  
   - **Description**: Contains features of flags from 193 countries, including:  
     - Colors (red, blue, green, etc.)  
     - Symbols (religious symbols, crosses, etc.)  
     - Geographic information (landmass, zone)  
     - Population, language, religion  

2. **World Happiness Report 2019**  
   - **Source**: [Kaggle - World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness)  
   - **Description**: Contains happiness scores and detailed well-being indicators for 156 countries, such as:  
     - Happiness score  
     - GDP per capita  
     - Social support  
     - Healthy life expectancy  
     - Freedom to make life choices  
     - Generosity  
     - Perceptions of corruption

## Data Merging Plan  

Since the two datasets have different country lists (193 vs. 156), I will focus on **the common countries that appear in both datasets**.  

Steps:  
1. **Standardize country names** to match them correctly.  
2. **Merge the datasets** on country names.  
3. Handle missing data if necessary.

## Analysis Plan  

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Fix country name mismatches.  
   - Select relevant features.  
   - Handle missing values.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of flag features (colors, symbols, patterns).  
   - Visualization of happiness scores and flag elements.  
   - Comparing flag features across different continents or religions.  

3. **Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Example hypotheses:  
     - Do countries with blue flags have higher happiness scores?  
     - Is there a correlation between flags with religious symbols and GDP?  
     - Are certain colors more common in lower-income countries?  

4. **(Optional)** Machine Learning Modeling  
   - Predicting happiness score based on flag features (regression).  
   - Predicting high/low GDP category based on flag design (classification).  

5. **Conclusions & Insights**  
   - Summarizing the most interesting patterns and relationships found.

## Possible Challenges  

| Challenge                                  | Solution                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Country name mismatches**                 | Manual adjustments and fuzzy matching if needed.              |
| **Missing data in happiness scores**       | Imputation (filling gaps) or excluding some countries.         |
| **Encoding flag features for analysis**    | Using binary or one-hot encoding for categorical flag data.   |
| **Finding meaningful correlations**        | Focus on both data-driven results and social science context. |

## Future Work  

- Add more datasets (e.g., Democracy Index, Human Development Index) to deepen the analysis.  
- Include historical flag data to analyze changes over time.  
- Explore **interactive data visualizations** (e.g., Plotly, Dash) to present findings dynamically.  
- Apply advanced **machine learning models** to predict social indicators from flag designs.  

---

## Tools and Technologies  

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (optional)  
- **Statistical Analysis**: SciPy, Statsmodels  
- **Machine Learning (optional)**: Scikit-learn
